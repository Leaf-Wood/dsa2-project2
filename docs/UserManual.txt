This program simulates a queue using an event driven simulation, and also computes the analytical model and prints both results.
It reads from an input file containing the parameters:
- λ (arrival rate)
- μ (service rate)
- M (number of servers)
- numEvents (number of customers to simulate)

# Instructions:
1. In main.cpp, change the file name in the first line 'INPUT_FILE = "test1.txt";' to change the file the program reads. The test files are located in the tests/ folder.
2. Compile program using 'make' in the terminal
3. Run program using './main'
